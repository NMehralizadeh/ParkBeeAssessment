1. What architectures or patterns are you using currently or have worked on recently?
```Clean Architecture. I've Experienced with N-tier. And I read some documents about hexagonal and onion.```
2. What do you think of them and would you want to implement it again?
```As I experienced it's related to what do you want to do. But I found clean architecture more useful for enterprise projects which derived from onion architecture.```
3. What version control system do you use or prefer?
```git. I have experience with TFS as well but after getting familiar with git, I prefer to use it because of the policy on the branch and that there is no need for any server and you can run on your local machine.```
4. What is your favorite language feature and can you give a short snippet on how you use it?
```I like all OOP aspects of C# like Generic class and interfaces or abstract class, But as I experience with some other languages like Go, PHP, and python I'd like to see multiple returns like them. We had "tuple" but it's not useful because of naming convention(Item1, Item2, ...). After the latest changes, we can have multiple returns more readable.```
5. What future or current technology do you look forward to the most or want to use and why?
```I don't have any limitations on technology. I R&D to find the useful solution then I will start to learn and implement them, Like Docker, Redis, ... . I've experienced with Reactjs but used Angular as you recommend to implement.```
6. How would you find a production bug/performance issue? Have you done this before?
```Yes, I have. Review monitoring platform for performance issues (APM, Sentry, ...) and data to find the problem that occurred. I try to reproduce the bug raised by the user to find the problem.```
7. How would you improve the sample API (bug fixes, security, performance, etc.)?
```I read readme.md and requirement that you asked to implement and make some changes on API like authorize attribute fo security and use async-await for performance to prevent locking process.```
